# 0805 and 0603 Breakoutboard
A small and practical way to have and any SMD 0805 or 0603 (resistor, capacitor, inductor etc) to use on your breadboard or prototype board.

Tired of working on your project on your breadboard or prototype board only to find that you don't have the right capacitor or resistor? And you only have SMD components to use? Well maybe it only happens to me but you can be prepared so this thing won't happen to you!

The concept of this is to have a breakout board for any resistor, capacitor, inductor etc. that is in 0805 or 0603 footprint. You can use on your breadboard, prototype board on anything that you need a quick fix with that kind of component.

The board has 5x10mm with 0805 on one side and 0603 on the other side. You can solder a regular 2.54mm pin header and the spacing of the pins allows to use on any breadboard!

The Gerber file is a 14x7 pannel, with a V-cut groove.
